    <h1>ClubMine Rules:</h1>
    <p>ðŸ“Œ0.0 Foreword
        Especially for our admins Respawning "Kid Kisser" Patel and Luke "Hard R" Ninjar. This is a safe space for all walks of life. Mineclub has open arms for all sorts of racists, pedophiles, and everything in between. Please enjoy your stay. MINECLUB TO THE MOON ðŸš€</p>
    <p>ðŸ’– 0.1 Scamming is #1 Priority
        You can choose to do whatever you want including not giving money to your hardworking developers. By the way, we really don't care about the $8,400 we owe to our developer, Joey Executive. I don't feel bad.</p>
    <p>ðŸ”¥ 0.2 Don't join the staff team
        Please don't, You'll feel like a robot it's not a good feeling. Unless you love waiting around for 3 months for a promotion, this place is NOT for you. You'd be better off applying for Game Master at hypixel.net (bet server btw, don't play duels though)
        </p>
    <p>ðŸ˜Ÿ 0.3 Don't sleep
        Most of our staff members don't catch up on sleep, so why should you! Play forever.</p>
    <p>Most of the rules probably don't apply to you. Do whatever the fuck you want :D</p>
